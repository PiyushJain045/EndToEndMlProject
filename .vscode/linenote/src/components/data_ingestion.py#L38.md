What Does It Do?
Saves the DataFrame to a CSV File:

The to_csv() method is used to write the DataFrame (df) to a CSV file.

The file is saved at the path specified by self.ingestion_config.raw_data_path.

Parameters:

index=False: This tells to_csv() not to write row indices to the file. Row indices are usually not needed in the saved file.

header=True: This tells to_csv() to include the column names as the first row in the file.
